    <p>I am in the process of getting my bachelor's degree and minor in IT. I am currently a technical writer and I enjoy my current position.</p>
    <p>I am a mother of 2 amazing kids. My daughter is almost 14 and my son would be 18 but he is forever 12 due to his fight with brain cancer.</p>
    <p>I enjoy traveling in my free time. We try to make it to Guatamala at least one time a year to see my husbands family. Guatamal is a beautiful place to visit and experience.
      I also enjoy spending time with my daughter and going to the movies and exploring new things.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I am passionate about helping kids and their families when going through hard and unbearable times. There needs to be more research for childhood cancer.</p>
